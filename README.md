## Project Description:  
### Softwares and Techstack used:
- Leaflet (for map)
- Javascript
- Python 
- CSS 
- HTML 

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive solution for visualizing flood levels on streets and assisting users in finding the flood-safe zones during flood events. By processing rainfall data and integrating it with mapping technology, users can access real-time information about flood-prone areas and make informed decisions to ensure their safety and well-being.

### Features   
- **`Flood Level Mapping:`** graphically depicts the flood intensity of every street
- **`Flood safe zone finder:`** shows flood safe zones 
- **`Flood danger zone finder:`** shows flood danger zones 
- **`User friendly interface:`** easy to use 

### Target Audience: 
- **`General Public:`** Residents, commuters, and travelers can use the application to stay informed about flood risks and plan safe travel routes during inclement weather conditions.
- **`Emergency Responders:`** First responders and emergency management agencies can leverage the tool to assess flood situations, coordinate rescue operations, and allocate resources effectively.
- **`Government Agencies:`** Municipalities, local governments, and disaster management authorities can utilize the platform for flood risk assessment, mitigation planning, and public awareness campaigns.

### Future Enhancements:
- **`Real-Time Data Integration:`** Incorporate real-time rainfall and weather data for dynamic updates and more accurate flood level predictions.
- **`Mobile Application:`** Develop a mobile application version for on-the-go access to flood information and safe zone finder functionality.
- **`Community Engagement:`** Implement community engagement features such as crowdsourced reporting, user-generated content, and community forums to foster collaboration and information sharing among residents.
